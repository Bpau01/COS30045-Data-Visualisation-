				The choropleth map illustrates the number of immigrants in Australia from various countries over the
				years. The data revealed that China, India and Malaysia are the top three countries that contributes to
				immigrationin Australia before the Covid-19 outbreak. However, Afghanistan repalced Malaysia among the
				top three countries after the reopening of the Australian border. Throughout the years, the data
				indicates that the number of immigrants has fluctuated throughout time with a slight increase or decline
				observed. Notably, there were no sudden surges or drops with the exception of the Covid-19 period,
				indicating a consistent immigration pattern.

				The donut chart displays the distribution of visa classifications, which include temporary visas,
				permanent visas, and others. Temporary visas have the greatest percentage of these categories,
				accounting for 58.2% of the total. The majority of temporary visa holders are higher education students,
				followed by visitors and persons on working holidays. Permanent visas account for the second-largest
				share, with the remaining visa types falling into the "others" group. This figure shows the visa
				distribution, emphasising the importance of temporary visas, especially for higher education students.

				The line chart depicts the number of immigrants and international students in Australia from 2012 to
				2022. In 2018, the number of immigrants and international students in Australia was at its peak. Based
				on the line chart, it is evident that both lines exhibit a similar trend across time, with both
				experiencing increases and decreases. This demonstrates a correlation between the two variables and
				emphasises the country's reliance on immigration and international student enrolment.
